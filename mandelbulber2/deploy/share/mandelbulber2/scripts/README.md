This folder contains scripts to use with Mandelbulber.

For this to work you will need to install php in your system. 
Then you can invoke these scripts on the command line with `php [SCRIPT_NAME].php`.

- mbSettings.php & mbSettingsExamples.php 
	Sometimes Mandelbulber comes short when doing sophisticated parameter manipulation.
	The MbSettings class in mbSettings.php can be used to script your own logic.
	See also useful examples in mbSettingsExamples.php on how to use this class.
